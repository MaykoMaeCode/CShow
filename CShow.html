    <h2>The CDrama Site</h2>
    
    <h3>Wuxia, Xianxia, and More</h3>
    
    <p>This site was made out of a love for wuxia, xianxia, and the occational historical/costume drama. </p>
    
    <h4>The Happy Ending</h4>

      <p>Not every show needs a happy ending --- but for Blue and Mayko the ending is crucial, and sometimes it takes knowing the ending to have the courage to embark on a 50 episode cryfest.</p>
      
    <p>A key function of this site is to track information on dramas' endings, recording whether a given drama has a happy ending (HE) or not. <br> 
      This mission is inspired by much pain in our past.</p>

    <h4>Our Greatest Loves</h4>
