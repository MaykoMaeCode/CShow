<h1>Endings: What makes them Good?</h1>
<br>A good ending in our prespective has several things: 
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Are the stories' strings neatly wrapped up?</li>
  <li>Was there Character development?</li>
  <li>Did it feel as though the ending 'fit' the rest of the story?</li>
  <li>And, arguably the most important question, Was then ending&nbsp; 
    <em>Satisfying?</em>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>You may notice that we did&nbsp; 
<strong>Not&nbsp;</strong>add in 'was the ending happy?' Odd considering the entire point of this web page is to identify Chinese Drama's with happy endings. Happy endings are importiant, but not crucial to a&nbsp; 
<strong>Good Ending</strong>
