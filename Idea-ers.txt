Just Ideas for the site
**we could have an 'actors' tab that we link all the main cast from the shows we talk about and any other wuxia/xianxia/historical drama that they act in as a lot of times there are cross overs
and who dosen't like to catch up on a fav
** clearly definned metrics that we rate each one for an over all score out of 10, 'happy ending' 'costumes' 'acting' 'artistic filming' 'action choreography' 'animations' 'music'
** each show gets its own page, the top of the page has a 'no spoiler' bit with a light summery or whatever, then after that our rating and the end bit, then after that some bits on spoilers
and other disscussion on the show or whatever else
